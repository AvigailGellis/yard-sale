# yard-sale
I am currently holding a weekly yard sale in an empty lot near my home. What started out as a one-time hasty venture meant to rid my house of all its accumulated junk, has quickly exploded into a real business. But a real business needs a real database, in order to make order of all the chaos (which is increasing as we speak).

I am seeking a competent software devoper to help me with this.

The full comprehensive spec can be found in the repo...

## Deliverables
I will need the following files:
1. table.sql (include database and table)
2. sampledata.sql
3. reports.sql 

See spec for more detail...

## SQL Requirements
These are non-negotiable...
- primary key
- properly named columns
- proper data types
- constraints
- files should be able to be run repeatedly

# THANK YOU!
