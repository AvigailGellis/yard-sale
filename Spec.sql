I am overwhelmed! Like up to my nose in stress! And you - yes YOU - have  the power to restore my peace of mind. With just a few clicks of the mouse...

You see, about half a year ago, I held a small, informal yard sale in front of my house. It was wildly successful - beyond anything I could've hoped for -and 
immediately after that initial event, I recieved a multitude of requests to  run a second sale. So I did... and then I did it again... and again... until my house
was practically rid of all its junk (and admittedly some non-junk items as well). Well, then the donations started pouring in. Because once word got around that 
my yard was a veritable junk yard, everyone had the brilliant idea to drop off all of their unused stuff... because it's a mess anyway, right? 

So that's how that one-time spur-of-the-moment venture became a weekly sale in an abandoned lot in my neighborhood.

Well I can't really complain because ultimately everyone else's garbage has turned me into a business woman. Running a real business. (With a real name - "Not A Dump"). And making real money.
But still, it's incredibly chaotic, and I cannot for the life of me keep track of what's coming in and what's going out, and probably many people are walking off 
with free items simply because the prices are not being tracked.

So, yeah. Stress.

But you can help me!
Because you can record all of the necessary data in a neat database.

So here goes...

I need to keep track of every single item that passes through my yard, and record its name, description, and the category of "stuff" that it falls under.
The main categories are as follows:
1) Home
2) Recreation 
3) Equipment
4) Clothing
5) Misc

I also need to record the date that the item was put out and the date it was sold (if applicable). 
And, of course, the price needs to be tracked.

Also, I recently hired a teenager from the neighborhood to help with some of the organization and set-up. She then gets 20% of the earnings.
So I need to record her salary, as well as the take-home pay for myself.

Questions:
Q: Have you ever bought anything specifically for the sale?
A: No! The donations that I receive and the stuff that I already have are the ONLY items which are put out. Therefore, it's all profit...

Q: Have you ever given away anything for free?
A: Um...yes. Because of the mess, there are sometimes items lying around which weren't intentionally meant to be put out, and are therefore not tagged.
   Usually, they are too old or ragged for me to charge the buyer in good consience, and I let them take it for no cost.

Q: Do you need to record the donors?
A: Yes! I forgot to mention this part. If someone gives at least 3 donations (not 3 items, 3 separate drop-offs on 3 separate dates), they receive a complementary
   "Not A Dump" t-shirt! (This gesture is being supported by a kind neighbor and is NOT coming from my own pocket.) 

Reports:
1) For advertising purposes, I need to know which items I should be aiming to receive. Therefore, show me a list of the categories ordered by popularity (most popular on the top).
2) I want to upgrade the price tags. Each category should have it's own color sticker (you can choose), and the text should be formatted as such: item name (category name): price, date put out
   (I want the color and the text in separate columns. And just show me a list, please, as a preview of what they would look like.)
3) I am considering reducing the price of all items that are still not sold after 3 months of sitting there. Show me a 50% reduction on all such items.
4) The "t-shirt" neighbor wants to customize the shirts! Show me a list of the "worthy" donors and their t-shirts, formatted as: "Not A Dump", Thanks to YOU, <donor name>!
